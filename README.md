# Notes App 

## Purpose

A note app that allows users to write text to each note, save it in local storage, delete an existing note, dynamically search among the notes, and set a character limit. The project makes use of components, props, useState(), useffect(), and React Hooks to handle HTML input. Flexbox and Grid CSS styles. API for local storage.  This employs React hooks and conditions combined with the Modern Javascript Fetch API. This was my first project using React JS.
